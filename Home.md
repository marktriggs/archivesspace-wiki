## ArchivesSpace
### Building a next-generation archives management tool

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

The ArchivesSpace project is in an alpha release stage.  This is the page you can come to for directions about how to install and help us test this tool during the alpha and beta development phases.

## [[Quick Start]]
Run a test version with an embedded database.

## [[Installing in Tomcat and Mysql]]
Deploy `.war` on tomcat using mysql database.

## [ArchivesSpace google group](http://groups.google.com/group/archivesspace)
Join our community of archivists and technologists working together to build a next-generation archives management tool. 

## [Source Code Documentation](http://archivesspace.github.com/archivesspace/doc/alpha_index.html)
Class, method, backend [API](http://archivesspace.github.com/archivesspace/doc/file.API.html) and schema documentation. 

## Why another page of docs?

Right now, the [`README.md`](https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace/blob/master/README.md) has some directions and a link to [`http://hudmol.github.com/archivesspace/`](http://hudmol.github.com/archivesspace/) which is the `gh-pages` branch (which is also [here](http://hudmol.github.com/archivesspace/)) so why start another place for documentation?  This page, at least right now, is focused on the alpha and beta testing phases and how the community can get involved in this phase.
