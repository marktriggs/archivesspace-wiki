## Browser Requirements for Staff and Public Users

ArchivesSpace uses a tiered approach to browser support in order to guarantee accessibility to a broad base of users and cutting edge functionality to power users.

### Support Tiers

| Support Tier | Support in Staff Frontend Application | Support in Public Discovery User Interface |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Gold | Users can execute all workflow functions, including dynamic record linking and rearrangement through drag and drop UI. | Full support of all design and layout. |
| Silver | Users can perform all basic record editing, reporting, import and export tasks, but may not be able to perform, e.g., dynamic record linking and rearrangement through the drag and drop UI. | Good support of design and layout, but some allowance for design elements that degrade or do not render exactly as designed (e.g., a button appearing with angled rather than rounded corners) |
| Bronze | No support guaranteed. Staff users will receive a message encouraging them to switch to a supported browser. | All pages are readable and navigable, but the aesthetic quality of the site may be lowered significantly (e.g., system buttons rather than designed buttons). |
