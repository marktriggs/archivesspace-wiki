ArchivesSpace Dependencies

 * `git` is needed to clone the source repository.
 * JDK 1.6 or JDK 1.7 is needed by embedded `ant` to build (should run okay on JRE)
 * `node` on the $PATH will speed up the build
 * J2EE server such as `tomcat`; two instances will need to be set up (one for the front end, one for the back end)

Once these are installed, the directions at [[Tomcat Mysql Deployment]] should work.
